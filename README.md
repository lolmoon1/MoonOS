# MoonOS
Since ive failed at staying commited to any project, here's another.
# My Plan
My plan is to make a OS (Operating System) of sorts that would act similar to a dev enviroment that allows customitation for the needs of the user.
# Roadmap
My main goal is to have a "fully functioning" os made from scripts and c programs to allow full compatibility for the main linux distrobutions (or at least the c based ones).
